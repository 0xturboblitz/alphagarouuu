Final History:

PAUL: Let's stay vigilant. Anyone seemed off lately?

SARAH: John was oddly quiet yesterday, wasnâ€™t he?

JOHN: I was observing, not hiding. By the way, Paul, you've been pretty proactive, haven't you?

EMMA: I agree with John, Sarah. Aren't you quick to accuse others? Seems suspicious to me.

CHRIS: Interesting thoughts, Emma. Defending John makes me wonder about your intentions.

PAUL: Noticing things doesn't warrant being proactive, John. And Emma, defending John as quickly as you did is suspicious, isn't it?

SARAH: Chris, you have a point. Emma defending John was hasty, maybe there's more to their alliance?

JOHN: Doesn't the speed of your accusations behold a hidden agenda, Sarah? Maybe, along with Paul and Chris?

EMMA: Chris, aren't you conveniently agreeing? And Sarah, are you accusing to deflect your own guilt?

CHRIS: Emma, your accusation seems deflective. Are you and John protecting each other?


Paul:
VOTE: Emma
THOUGHTS for the votes: Emma's quick defense of John and Sarah's allegations against Emma and John seem suspicious, but Sarah's suspicions may be a ploy to throw us off her own trail. However, Chris's neutral stance and no visible defense or alliance sways me towards believing he might not be a werewolf. Emma's defensive behavior and quick finger pointing seem more suspicious.

Sarah:
VOTE: Emma
THOUGHTS for the votes: I need to shift the suspicion onto someone else to protect myself and my fellow werewolf. John is already under suspicion, and Emma's quick defence of him makes her a potential target as well. Voting against her might propel others to do the same and eliminate one of the villagers instead of a werewolf.

John:
VOTE: Chris
THOUGHTS for the votes: Paul is a good bet, being proactive might be a way of controlling the conversation and directing suspicion away from himself. However, the way Chris and Sarah quickly jumped on accusing Emma and me seems too convenient. It's hard to pinpoint clearly, but my gut is telling me that the werewolves might be Chris and Sarah, trying to blend in quickly by jumping in to accuse. They are a little too eager to accuse, without sufficient reasoning.

Emma:
VOTE: John
THOUGHTS for the votes: It's clear that suspicion is pointing towards me and John. However, it's also apparent that Sarah and Chris are teaming up. If I can spin this situation to my advantage and play along with Sarah and Chris's theory of me and John being in an alliance, perhaps I can steer clear of suspicion for another round. Better yet, if I vote John out, it may diffuse any suspicions towards me.

Chris:
VOTE: Emma
THOUGHTS for the votes: Emma and John have been accused repeatedly and both have been defensive. Rather than providing logical counterarguments, they have defended each other suspiciously. And Sarah is quick to accuse others which could be a strategy to deflect attention from herself. However, I feel Emma's behaviour is a bit more alarming.
