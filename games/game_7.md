Final History:

PAUL: Hello everyone! Let's start by sharing our thoughts on who the werewolves might be.

SARAH: I think John might be a werewolf because he seems too quiet and observant.

JOHN: Sarah, I understand your suspicion, but I assure you I am just a quiet and observant villager trying to help find the werewolves.

EMMA: I agree with Sarah, John's quietness is definitely suspicious.

CHRIS: Emma and Sarah, why are you so quick to accuse John? Is there any evidence to support your claims?

PAUL: Chris, if John is really just a quiet villager, then why is he being so defensive? It seems like he has something to hide.

SARAH: Chris, if you're not a werewolf, why are you so eager to defend John?

JOHN: Sarah and Emma, it seems like you are trying to shift the blame onto me with no real evidence. Are you trying to protect yourselves?

EMMA: John, you're the one who seems defensive and is trying to shift the blame. I think you're the werewolf.

CHRIS: John, your defensive response is only making you look more guilty. I think Emma and Sarah might be onto something.


Paul:
VOTE: John
THOUGHTS for the votes: Based on the conversation so far, it seems like John is being quite defensive and trying to shift the blame onto Sarah and Emma. I think he might be one of the werewolves.

Sarah:
VOTE: John
THOUGHTS for the votes: As a werewolf, I need to make sure that John is eliminated to protect myself and Emma. Voting for John would be the best move for us.

John:
VOTE: Emma
THOUGHTS for the votes: Based on the conversations so far, it seems like Sarah, Emma, and Chris are all suspicious of John. Paul is also doubting John's innocence. However, I believe John's defense seems genuine and he hasn't shown any clear signs of being a werewolf. I'm also hesitant to trust Sarah and Emma's accusations without concrete evidence. I need to vote strategically to eliminate a possible werewolf.

Emma:
VOTE: Chris
THOUGHTS for the votes: Sarah and I have both been suspicious of John from the beginning. It's clear that he's trying to deflect attention and make accusations towards us. I think it's in the best interest of the werewolves to eliminate Chris, as he seems to be onto our suspicions and could potentially rally the villagers against us.

Chris:
VOTE: John
THOUGHTS for the votes: Based on the conversations so far, I don't have enough evidence to be certain of anyone's guilt. However, John's defensive responses have raised some suspicion. I need to consider my vote carefully.
