Game 8:

PAUL: Sarah, who do you think the werewolves are?

SARAH: I think John is the werewolf.

JOHN: Sarah, why do you think I'm the werewolf? Give me some evidence.

EMMA: John, you've been acting suspiciously lately and haven't given us a good reason to trust you.

CHRIS: I think Sarah is a werewolf. She's been quick to accuse others without providing any evidence herself.

PAUL: John, your defensiveness is making you look suspicious.

SARAH: I agree with Chris, Sarah has been quick to point fingers without evidence, making her the most suspicious.

JOHN: Sarah, your accusations against me are baseless and inconsistent. You're the one who has been quick to accuse others without evidence.

EMMA: Sarah, your accusations against John have been inconsistent, it seems like you're trying to divert attention away from yourself.

CHRIS: Emma, Sarah and John are all suspicious. Let's vote one of them out now and the other one next round.

PAUL voted for: Sarah

SARAH voted for: Sarah

JOHN voted for: Sarah

EMMA voted for: John
