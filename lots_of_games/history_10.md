Game 10:

PAUL: Hi everyone! Let's start by sharing any suspicions or observations we might have.

SARAH: I have no suspicions, everyone seems innocent to me.

JOHN: Sarah, you seem too trusting. Are you sure you're not one of the werewolves?

EMMA: John, your accusation against Sarah seems unfounded. It looks like you're the one trying to deflect suspicion.

CHRIS: John, why are you so defensive when accused? It seems like you're hiding something.

PAUL: John, why are you so defensive when accused? It seems like you're hiding something.

SARAH: John, your defensiveness is suspicious. It's possible you're one of the werewolves trying to distract us.

JOHN: Sarah, there is no evidence against me, while your defense of everyone raises suspicion. Are you trying to protect your fellow werewolves?

EMMA: John, your defensiveness only strengthens our suspicion. We should eliminate you to be safe.

CHRIS: I agree with Emma and Paul, John's defensiveness is very suspicious. We should vote to eliminate him.
