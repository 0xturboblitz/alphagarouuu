Game 36:

PAUL: Who do you think is the most suspicious person here?

SARAH: I think John is the most suspicious because he has been quiet and not contributing to the conversation.

JOHN: I have been quiet because I was observing everyone's behavior to make an informed decision during the vote.

EMMA: I agree with Sarah, John's quietness is definitely suspicious.

CHRIS: I also find John's behavior suspicious. He could be trying to divert attention away from himself to make him appear innocent.

PAUL: John, your explanation doesn't seem genuine. It feels like a typical werewolf tactic to me.

SARAH: John is not suspicious. His observation is a valid strategy.

JOHN: I understand that my quietness can be seen as suspicious, but it was a deliberate strategy to make an informed decision during the vote.

EMMA: Paul, you are the most suspicious to me. You are consistently trying to shift blame onto others.

CHRIS: Emma, why do you think Paul is suspicious? Can you provide specific examples?
