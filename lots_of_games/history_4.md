Game 4:

PAUL: Hey everyone, what do you all think about the recent events? Any thoughts or suspicions?

SARAH: I think we should gather more information before making any accusations.

JOHN: Sarah, do you have any suspicions or any information that might help us?

EMMA: I agree with Sarah, we should gather more information before accusing anyone.

CHRIS: I've noticed that Sarah and John are being quite passive in the conversation, which makes me suspicious of them.

PAUL: Sarah and John, why have you been so passive in the conversation? Are you trying to hide something?

SARAH: Paul, don't let John and Chris's attempt to divert attention fool you. They are the real werewolves.

JOHN: Sarah, your accusation seems desperate. Do you have any evidence to support your claim?

EMMA: I agree with Sarah, John and Chris seem suspicious with their passive behavior and attempts to divert attention.

CHRIS: Sarah, why are you accusing me and John without any evidence? Are you trying to protect yourself?
