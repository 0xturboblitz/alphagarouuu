Game 29:

PAUL: Hey everyone, what do you think of the game so far?

SARAH: I agree with Paul, the game seems interesting so far. We should focus on gathering more information.

JOHN: Who do you think we should suspect as a possible werewolf?

EMMA: I think we should suspect Paul. He seems too eager and could be trying to manipulate the conversation.

CHRIS: I think we should suspect Emma. Accusing Paul seems like a werewolf move to divert suspicion.

PAUL: Emma, why do you think accusing Paul is a werewolf move? Could it be because you are a werewolf yourself and trying to shift blame?

SARAH: Emma is being wrongly accused. Paul's attempt to divert suspicion and his aggressive questioning of Emma is suspicious.

JOHN: Chris, why are you so quick to defend Emma and accuse Paul? It seems like you might be the other werewolf trying to protect your teammate.

EMMA: John, your quick defense of Chris seems suspicious. Are you trying to protect your fellow werewolf?

CHRIS: John, why are you so quick to defend Emma? It's possible that you are the other werewolf trying to protect your teammate.
