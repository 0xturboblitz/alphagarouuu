Game 28:

PAUL: Hey everyone, how is everybody doing today?

SARAH: I'm good, thanks. How about you, Paul?

JOHN: John: Chris, what do you think about Paul and Sarah's conversation?

EMMA: I think Chris is acting suspiciously. He hasn't spoken much and seems to be avoiding participating in the conversation.

CHRIS: I apologize for not speaking much, I've been busy today. I think we should focus on finding the werewolves instead of accusing each other.

PAUL: I agree with Emma, Chris has been very quiet and that seems suspicious to me.

SARAH: I think John is the most suspicious. He hasn't contributed much to the conversation and we should investigate him further.

JOHN: Paul, why did you agree with Emma's suspicion about Chris?

EMMA: John, why did you agree with Paul's suspicion about Emma?

CHRIS: John, your sudden agreement with Paul's suspicion about Emma seems like a way to divert attention from yourself.
