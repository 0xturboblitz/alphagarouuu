Game 13:

PAUL: Sarah, what do you think the best strategy is for the villagers to win?

SARAH: I believe the best strategy for the villagers to win is to closely observe everyone's behavior and look for inconsistencies.

JOHN: Sarah, what do you think about Paul's question? Do you have any suspicions?

EMMA: I agree with Sarah, observing behavior is key. I haven't noticed any suspicious behavior from anyone yet.

CHRIS: John, I haven't seen any inconsistencies in your behavior so far, but perhaps you have noticed something that could help us identify a werewolf?

PAUL: John, I find it interesting that you haven't mentioned anything suspicious about anyone yet. Are you trying to divert attention away from yourself?

SARAH: John, it's interesting that you haven't mentioned any suspicions yet. Are you perhaps trying to protect your werewolf partner?

JOHN: I haven't noticed any suspicious behavior from anyone yet.

EMMA: John, I find it odd that you haven't mentioned any suspicions yet. Are you perhaps trying to protect yourself?

CHRIS: John, why haven't you mentioned any suspicious behavior yet? Are you trying to hide something?
