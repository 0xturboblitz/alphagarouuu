Game 7:

PAUL: I think we should start by asking John and Emma where they were last night during the full moon.

SARAH: Paul, where were you last night during the full moon?

JOHN: I was at home, but Paul, you still haven't answered Sarah's question about where you were last night.

EMMA: I was at the cinema with Sarah, we watched a late-night horror movie.

CHRIS: Paul, since you didn't answer Sarah's question about where you were last night, it is highly suspicious and makes me think you might be a werewolf.

PAUL: I apologize for not answering earlier, but I was at a friend's surprise party last night. Chris, why are you so quick to accuse me?

SARAH: Chris, it's interesting how you accuse me without providing any alibi for yourself. Were you alone last night?

JOHN: John, you haven't given an alibi yet. Where were you last night?

EMMA: John, it's strange that you still haven't given an alibi. Are you hiding something?

CHRIS: John, it's crucial that you provide a clear and solid alibi. Your hesitation makes me suspect that you might be a werewolf.
