Game 16:

PAUL: Chris, who do you suspect of being a werewolf?

SARAH: Chris, I suspect John of being a werewolf as he seems too quiet and observant.

JOHN: Sarah, I understand your suspicions, but I am simply trying to observe and make informed decisions before accusing anyone.

EMMA: John, your observational skills could be seen as suspicious. Perhaps you are trying to blend in while secretly plotting with the other werewolf.

CHRIS: John, your defensiveness is making you look even more guilty.

PAUL: I agree with Sarah and Emma, John's behavior is suspicious.

SARAH: Emma, your consistent suspicion of John is suspicious in itself. Why are you so eager to point fingers?

JOHN: Chris, who do you suspect of being a werewolf?

EMMA: Sarah, why are you so quick to defend John? Is it because you are the other werewolf?

CHRIS: Sarah, your defense of John seems overly protective and defensive, which could indicate that you are the other werewolf.
