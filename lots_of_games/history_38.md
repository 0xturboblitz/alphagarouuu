Game 38:

PAUL: I was sleeping peacefully in my bed.

SARAH: I agree with Paul, I think we should focus on finding the werewolf among us villagers.

JOHN: I was with Sarah when the recent attack happened, so I couldn't be the werewolf.

EMMA: Sarah, if you were with John during the attack, can you confirm his alibi?

CHRIS: Emma, where were you during the recent attack?
