Game 32:

PAUL: null

SARAH: John, you seem awfully quiet. What do you have to say for yourself?

JOHN: Sorry, I'm just trying to gather information and observe everyone's behavior before making any accusations.

EMMA: John, your quietness seems suspicious. Are you trying to hide something?

CHRIS: Paul, why haven't you spoken yet? Do you have something to hide?

PAUL: Emma, why are you accusing John? Is it because you're a werewolf and trying to protect him?

SARAH: Chris, you haven't been very active in the conversation. Are you trying to hide your true identity as a werewolf?

JOHN: Paul, why are you accusing Emma? Are you trying to deflect attention from yourself as a possible werewolf?

EMMA: Chris, why are you accusing Paul? Are you trying to divert attention from yourself as a possible werewolf?
