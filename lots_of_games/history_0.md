Game 0:

PAUL: Chris, what do you think about the situation? Who do you suspect?

SARAH: I suspect John, he seems too quiet and observant, which could be a sign of trying to gather information for the werewolves.

JOHN: Sarah, being quiet and observant is not a sign of being a werewolf, it is a sign of being a careful villager. I suspect you, Sarah, because you are too quick to accuse others without solid evidence.

EMMA: Sarah, why are you so defensive? Maybe you're trying to divert attention from yourself.

CHRIS: Paul, I have a feeling you're deflecting attention and trying to confuse us. I suspect you're one of the werewolves.

PAUL: Chris, why are you trying to shift the focus away from yourself?

SARAH: Emma is trying to divert attention from herself by accusing me. She must be the other werewolf.

JOHN: Sarah, if you accuse Emma of diverting attention, it only means you're guilty of doing the same.

EMMA: Chris, I think you're onto something. Sarah's quick accusations and deflections are suspicious. We should consider voting for her.

CHRIS: I believe Sarah is the other werewolf because she is trying too hard to deflect suspicion onto others.
