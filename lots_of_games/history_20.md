Game 20:

PAUL: Chris, what were you doing last night?

SARAH: Sarah: Chris, do you have an alibi for last night? We need to figure out who the werewolves are.

JOHN: Chris, where were you during the time of the attack?

EMMA: Emma: John, why were you the only one who didn't ask Chris for an alibi last night?

CHRIS: I was at home all night, Paul. Sarah, why are you trying so hard to find a werewolf?

PAUL: I asked Chris because I wanted to find out if anyone with an alibi could corroborate Sarah's story.

SARAH: John, why did you not ask Chris for an alibi last night?

JOHN: John, why didn't you ask Emma for an alibi last night?
