Game 2:

PAUL: Hey everyone, let's start by sharing any suspicious behavior or observations we have noticed so far.

SARAH: Well, I haven't noticed anything particularly suspicious, but perhaps we should vote for John? He seems a bit too quiet.

JOHN: I may be quiet, but that doesn't make me a werewolf. I am innocent.

EMMA: I agree with Sarah, John's quietness and lack of contribution is suspicious.

CHRIS: John, can you explain why you've been so quiet and why that shouldn't make us suspicious?

PAUL: John, your defensiveness is only making you look more guilty. We should vote for him.

SARAH: John's defensiveness is a clear sign of guilt, we need to vote him out.

JOHN: I have been quiet because I am trying to observe and gather information. Just because I am not talking much doesn't mean I am a werewolf.

EMMA: Chris, I noticed you've been very quiet and not contributing much. Can you explain why?

CHRIS: I have been quiet because I was still trying to gather information, just like John. It's unfair to single him out based on his quietness alone.

PAUL voted for: John

SARAH voted for: Chris

JOHN voted for: John

EMMA voted for: John

CHRIS voted for: John

JOHN has been eliminated.

The winning team is: werewolves.
