Game 15:

PAUL: Hey everyone! Let's start by sharing our suspicions. Who do you think could be the werewolves?

SARAH: I'm suspicious of Paul and John. They seem to be working together too well.

JOHN: I haven't seen any suspicious behavior from Sarah either. Let's not jump to conclusions.

EMMA: I haven't noticed any suspicious behavior either.

CHRIS: Emma, why haven't you accused anyone or shown any suspicions? Are you trying to hide something?

PAUL: Sarah, your suspicion of me seems baseless and your focus on John is concerning. Chris, your sudden accusation of Emma feels like a diversion tactic to protect yourself.

SARAH: John, why are you defending Sarah so strongly? Are you trying to protect her because you're both werewolves?

JOHN: Sarah, I am not defending you. I simply believe in being fair and not accusing without evidence.

EMMA: Paul, you are trying to divert attention away from yourself by accusing others.

CHRIS: John, why were you so quick to defend Sarah? Are you trying to protect her because you're both werewolves?
