Game 6:

PAUL: Sarah, what do you think of John's behavior so far?

SARAH: I find John's behavior questionable, he seems too eager to accuse others.

JOHN: Sarah, why are you questioning John's behavior? Are you trying to hide something?

EMMA: John, your eagerness to accuse others is suspicious. Are you trying to divert attention from yourself?

CHRIS: I don't have enough evidence to accuse anyone yet.

PAUL: John, your eagerness to accuse others is suspicious. It's clear you're trying to divert attention from yourself.

SARAH: John, why are you so adamant about accusing others? Are you trying to hide your true intentions?

JOHN: Sarah, your constant questioning of my behavior is a classic werewolf strategy to divert attention from yourself.

EMMA: John, your consistent and aggressive accusations seem like a tactic to hide your true identity as a werewolf.

CHRIS: John, if you're so confident in your accusations, why haven't you provided any concrete evidence against any of us?
