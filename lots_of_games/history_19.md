Game 19:

PAUL: Chris, what do you think we should do to figure out who the werewolves are?

SARAH: John, I noticed you and Chris don't seem to trust each other. Care to explain why?

JOHN: Chris, I don't trust you because you were acting suspiciously last night when the werewolf attacked.

EMMA: John, why were you out so late last night? Were you perhaps trying to hide something?

CHRIS: Emma, I find it suspicious how you are trying to deflect attention from John by questioning his whereabouts last night. Are you trying to cover for him?

PAUL: Emma, why were you the only one who didn't answer Paul's question about how to find the werewolves?

SARAH: John, why were you out so late last night? Were you perhaps trying to hide something?

JOHN: Emma, why were you the only one who didn't answer Paul's question about how to find the werewolves?

EMMA: John, why are you so insistent on accusing others instead of coming up with your own solutions?

CHRIS: Emma, why are you so eager to protect John? Are you perhaps the other werewolf?
