PAUL: I find it interesting that John and Emma are so curious about what Paul and Chris have to say. It makes me wonder if they have something to hide themselves.

SARAH: I find it suspicious that John and Emma are so interested in what Paul and Chris have to say. It seems like they might be trying to divert attention from themselves.

JOHN: Sarah, why are you so quick to accuse John and Emma? It seems like you're trying to shift blame away from yourself.

EMMA: John, your defensive accusation makes me even more suspicious of you. Maybe you're trying to protect yourself.

CHRIS: John and Emma's defensive accusations make them even more suspicious.
