Game 11:

PAUL: Hello everyone, I hope we can work together to find the werewolves and keep our village safe.

SARAH: Hello Paul, I completely agree. We should all work together to find the werewolves and protect our village.

JOHN: Thank you both, Paul and Sarah, for your commitment to protecting the village. Let's hear from everyone else to gather more information.

EMMA: Emma, I believe your behavior is suspicious. Why haven't you contributed to the conversation yet?

CHRIS: I have been quiet because I've been observing. Emma, why are you pointing fingers instead of contributing useful information?

PAUL: Emma, why do you think pointing fingers at others is more productive than sharing your own thoughts and suspicions?

SARAH: Emma, I find it suspicious how eager you are to accuse others without providing any valuable information yourself.

JOHN: Emma, instead of accusing others, why don't you share any suspicions or information you have about the werewolves?

EMMA: I think John is acting suspiciously. He has been very quiet and hasn't contributed much to the conversation.

CHRIS: Emma, please provide specific reasons why you find John suspicious instead of making baseless accusations.
