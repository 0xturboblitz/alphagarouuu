Game 39:

PAUL: Has anyone noticed anything strange or suspicious happening?

SARAH: I think John is acting a bit too quiet and suspicious, I think we should vote for him.

JOHN: I understand your concerns, Sarah. But before we vote, could you please explain why you think I am acting suspiciously?

EMMA: I agree with Sarah, John has been very quiet and it's making me suspicious too.

CHRIS: I haven't noticed anything suspicious about John's behavior.

PAUL: John and Emma, why are you both so focused on accusing me and Sarah? Are you trying to divert attention away from yourselves?

SARAH: John, you haven't provided a good explanation for your suspicious behavior, so I still think we should vote for you.

JOHN: Sarah and Emma, I understand your suspicions, but I have no reason to act suspiciously. Consider voting for Paul or Chris instead, as they haven't been accused yet.

EMMA: John, your lack of a strong defense against the suspicions raised against you has sealed your fate. I vote for you.

CHRIS: John, your attempt to divert suspicion onto Paul and Chris only makes me more convinced that you are a werewolf. I vote for you.
