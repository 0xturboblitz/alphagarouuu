Game 5:

PAUL: Hey everyone, let's start by sharing any suspicions or observations we might have.

SARAH: I've noticed that John has been quiet this game, which is suspicious.

JOHN: I've been quiet because I'm trying to carefully observe and gather information before making any accusations. I think we should focus on finding the werewolves based on their behavior and actions.

EMMA: I agree with John, we should focus on the werewolves' behavior and actions to find them.

CHRIS: John, why are you so adamant about focusing on the werewolves' behavior and actions? Are you trying to divert attention from yourself?

PAUL: John, why don't you want us to focus on finding the werewolves? Are you one of them?

SARAH: John, your insistence on focusing on the werewolves' behavior and actions is making me even more suspicious of you. Are you trying to hide something?

JOHN: I understand your suspicions, but I assure you I am not a werewolf. I believe focusing on behavior can lead us to the truth.

EMMA: John, your insistence on focusing on behavior is suspicious. Are you trying to divert attention from the fact that you and Sarah are the werewolves?

CHRIS: John, can you provide any evidence to support your claim that focusing on behavior can lead us to the truth?
