Game 26:

PAUL: Hey everyone, let's start by stating our suspicions. Who do you think might be a werewolf and why?

SARAH: I suspect Chris because he's been acting strangely, and his actions align with the werewolves' agenda.

JOHN: I don't think we have enough evidence to accuse Chris. We should keep an eye on him, but there are other players we should also consider.

EMMA: I agree with John, let's gather more evidence before accusing anyone.

CHRIS: Sarah, I can understand your suspicion, but I assure you I am just a regular villager. I suggest we focus on gathering more evidence before jumping to conclusions.

PAUL: Sarah, why are you so sure about Chris? Can you provide more specific reasons for your suspicion?

SARAH: John, you've been overly defensive since the beginning, it's suspicious.

JOHN: Sarah, I understand your suspicions, but we need solid evidence before accusing anyone.

EMMA: John, why are you so quick to dismiss Sarah's suspicion of Chris and yet so hesitant to accuse Paul?

CHRIS: Sarah, why are you so quick to suspect Chris and yet hesitant to accuse Emma?
