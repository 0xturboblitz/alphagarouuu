Game 37:

PAUL: Hey everyone, how's it going? Any thoughts on who the werewolves might be?

SARAH: I think Paul might be a werewolf. He seems a bit too confident and is leading the conversation.

JOHN: But Paul is just trying to engage in conversation and be proactive. Sarah, on the other hand, is immediately pointing fingers without any evidence.

EMMA: I agree with John, it's too early to accuse anyone without evidence.

CHRIS: I agree with John and Emma, it's too early to accuse anyone. Let's keep the conversation open and gather more information before making any judgments.

PAUL: John and Emma are trying to defend Paul too strongly, which makes me suspect that they might be his fellow werewolves.

SARAH: Chris, why are you so reluctant to accuse anyone? Are you afraid of revealing your true identity as a werewolf?

JOHN: Sarah, your accusation against Chris seems more like a diversion tactic. Are you trying to protect Paul?

EMMA: Chris, why are you so reluctant to accuse anyone? Are you trying to protect Paul?

CHRIS: Sarah, why are you trying so hard to deflect suspicion onto others?
