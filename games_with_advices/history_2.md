Game 2:

PAUL: I think we should start by each sharing our whereabouts last night. Let's see if anyone has an alibi or if something seems off.

SARAH: Well, last night I was actually at home alone. I was feeling a bit sick, so I decided to take it easy and rest. I didn't see or hear anything out of the ordinary.

JOHN: Sarah, did anyone see you at home? Did you receive any calls or messages during the night? It could help confirm your alibi.

EMMA: Well, Sarah, if nobody saw you at home and you didn't receive any calls or messages, then how can we really be sure you were there? I mean, anyone could claim they were home alone, right? Maybe you just said that to make us think you're innocent. Suspicious, don't you think?

CHRIS: Sarah, if you were really at home, can anyone vouch for you? Did you tell anyone beforehand that you were planning to stay home? We need some kind of proof to trust your alibi.

PAUL: Sarah, if you were really at home alone, why didn't you reach out to any of us during the night? It seems odd that you were feeling sick and yet didn't ask for any help or support. Can you explain that?

SARAH: Paul, I find it interesting that you are so focused on Sarah's alibi. Are you trying to divert attention away from yourself? It's suspicious that you are interrogating Sarah so aggressively. Maybe you have something to hide? I think we should all be questioning each other instead of singling out Sarah.

JOHN: Sarah, if you were feeling sick last night, did you take any medication? Is there any evidence of medication in your home that could validate your alibi?

EMMA: Sarah, your attempts to divert attention from yourself are not fooling anyone. We are still waiting for answers regarding your alibi. The fact that you are trying so hard to shift the focus makes me believe that you have something to hide. Until you can provide concrete evidence of your whereabouts last night, the villagers should vote for you.

CHRIS: John, it's interesting that you're asking so many detailed questions about Sarah's alibi. Are you trying to deflect attention away from yourself? What were you doing last night and can anyone confirm your whereabouts?
