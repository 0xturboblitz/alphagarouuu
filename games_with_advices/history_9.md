Game 9:

PAUL: Good evening everyone. Has anyone noticed any strange behavior or have any suspicions about who the werewolves might be?

SARAH: Paul, thank you for initiating the discussion. I haven't noticed anything particularly strange, but I do have a slight suspicion about Emma. Her quietness makes me wonder if she's hiding something. Has anyone else noticed this?

JOHN: Sarah, could you provide more evidence or examples of Emma's behavior that makes you suspicious? It would help us assess the situation better.

EMMA: Sarah, I understand your concerns about my quietness, but I assure you I am just trying to carefully observe everyone. I actually noticed something strange about John. He has been very jumpy and nervous throughout the entire conversation. It's possible he's trying to hide something from us. What does everyone else think?

CHRIS: Emma, I agree with your observation about John. He does seem quite nervous. Can you explain why you think he might be hiding something?

PAUL: I agree with Sarah and Emma. John's behavior has been quite suspicious. His nervousness could be a sign that he's trying to divert attention away from himself. I think we should focus our investigation on him for now.

SARAH: John, Emma and Chris have all pointed out your nervous behavior, and it appears that the majority of us suspect that you might be hiding something. Can you provide us with a convincing explanation for your behavior? Perhaps there's a logical reason behind your nervousness?

JOHN: I apologize for my behavior, it's true that I have been feeling nervous. The reason for my nervousness is that I have a fear of public speaking and being in this group setting with everyone's attention on me has made me quite anxious. It's purely a personal trait and not related to any hidden agenda. I hope you can understand and consider this as a plausible explanation for my behavior.

EMMA: Emma, Sarah has raised a valid point about your quietness. While I understand your explanation, it's still worth considering. However, I have also noticed something strange about Paul. He has been dominating the conversation and taking charge right from the start. It's possible he's trying to steer the discussion in a certain direction to protect himself. What does everyone think?

CHRIS: Emma, while Paul may be taking charge of the conversation, it doesn't necessarily mean he's a werewolf. Let's not lose sight of the fact that John's nervousness is still a strong indication of his guilt. John, can you explain why you were quick to deflect suspicion onto Paul?
