Game 7:

PAUL: Hey everyone, who do you think is the most suspicious player and why?

SARAH: I think the most suspicious player is John. He has been very quiet and not participating in the conversation. I find it suspicious that he is not actively trying to find the werewolves. It seems like he might be trying to hide something.

JOHN: Sarah, I understand that you might find my silence suspicious, but I assure you that I haven't been speaking up because I've been observing everyone's behavior. I'm trying to gather as much information as possible before making any accusations. I believe that jumping to conclusions based on someone's silence is not a fair assessment. I am genuinely trying to find the werewolves, just in my own way.

EMMA: John, I appreciate your explanation, but I find it quite convenient that you suddenly decided to speak up only after Sarah accused you. It almost seems like you are trying to divert attention away from yourself. Sarah's suspicion of you does make sense, especially considering your silence earlier. Can you provide any concrete evidence to support your claim of trying to find the werewolves? It just seems a bit too convenient to me.

CHRIS: John, I understand that you were observing, but simply observing doesn't prove your innocence. You need to provide more substantial evidence that you were actively trying to find the werewolves. Just saying that you were doing it in your own way doesn't hold much weight. What specific actions did you take to find the werewolves?

PAUL: John, while I understand that everyone has their own way of approaching the game, it is still important to provide some evidence of your efforts. Can you give us any specific actions you took or observations you made that could help us identify the werewolves?

SARAH: Well, it seems like John is really struggling to provide any concrete evidence of his efforts to find the werewolves. His explanations are vague and don't hold much weight. I understand that it's important to gather information, but actions speak louder than words. John's silence and lack of substantial evidence still make him the most suspicious in my eyes. I think we should focus our attention on him for now.

JOHN: Sarah, I understand your suspicion towards me, but let me clarify my actions. While I haven't been vocal in the conversation, I have been actively observing everyone's behavior. I've been paying close attention to the interactions between players and noting any suspicious behavior. For example, during the first round, I noticed Chris trying to steer the conversation away from himself when questioned by Paul. This indicates a possible attempt to hide something. Emma, you accused me of conveniently speaking up after Sarah accused me, but it was a strategic move to expose the werewolves' attempt to divert attention. I didn't want to reveal my observations earlier because it would have given the werewolves a chance to change their behavior. I believe my silent observation strategy has been fruitful in identifying potential werewolves, and I'm now prepared to share my findings.

EMMA: John, while your explanation of silently observing everyone's behavior is interesting, it can also be seen as a clever cover-up for your own actions as a werewolf. By not actively participating in the conversation, you have successfully diverted suspicion away from yourself and onto others. Your sudden accusations towards Chris, for example, could be seen as an attempt to deflect attention from your own guilt. It's worth considering that your observation strategy is simply a facade to mask your true identity as a werewolf. Based on this, I believe it would be in the villagers' best interest to vote against you and eliminate a possible werewolf from our midst.

CHRIS: John, while your observation strategy may seem strategic, it can also be seen as a convenient excuse to deflect suspicion away from yourself. Your sudden accusations towards Chris seem more like a distraction tactic than genuine findings. Can you provide any concrete evidence or observations that directly implicate someone as a werewolf? Otherwise, your strategy seems highly suspicious and self-serving.
