Game 1:

PAUL: Hey everyone, let's start by introducing ourselves. It might help us to identify any suspicious behavior.

SARAH: Hi Paul, that's a great idea. I'm Sarah, happy to meet everyone!

JOHN: Hi Sarah, nice to meet you too. Have any of you noticed anything suspicious so far?

EMMA: Actually, I have noticed something. Greg seems to be quite quiet. It's always the quiet ones you have to watch out for.

CHRIS: Emma, can you provide more details about why you think Greg is suspicious?

FLORENT: Emma, do you have any specific examples of Greg's suspicious behavior?

LÉO: Actually, now that you mention it, Paul has been unusually eager to lead this conversation, which could be a tactic to divert attention from himself.

QUENTIN: Leo, I think you might be onto something. Paul, why are you so eager to lead the conversation?

CHARBEL: I've also noticed that Greg has been quite quiet. It's suspicious how he's not participating much in the conversation.

SAM: I haven't noticed anything suspicious yet, but I'm keeping an eye out.

GREG: Emma and Charbel, I've been quiet because I'm just getting a feel for the conversation and the players. I haven't noticed anything suspicious yet, but I'm keeping an open mind.

PAUL: Leo, I'm eager to lead the conversation because I want to find the werewolves and protect the villagers. It's simply my way of being proactive.

SARAH: Greg, your explanation for being quiet seems rehearsed. It's almost as if you're trying to cover up something.

JOHN: Greg, can you provide more information about your suspicions? Who do you think might be a werewolf?

EMMA: Greg, it seems like you're deflecting the suspicion onto others. Can you provide a concrete reason why you think someone else might be a werewolf?

CHRIS: Greg, who do you suspect might be a werewolf? Do you have any specific reasons for your suspicions?

FLORENT: Greg, why do you suspect Paul? Do you have any specific reasons or evidence?

LÉO: Emma, you seem to be quickly jumping on the suspicion bandwagon without providing concrete evidence. Are you trying to divert attention from yourself?

QUENTIN: Greg, can you provide more details about what you've observed so far?

CHARBEL: I suspect Quentin. He has been strangely quiet and hasn't contributed much to the conversation.

SAM: Charbel, why are you so quick to suspect Quentin? Do you have any concrete reasons or evidence?

GREG: Paul seems suspicious because he has been overly eager to lead the conversation and deflect attention from himself.
