Game 2:

PAUL: Hey everyone, let's start discussing who we think the werewolves might be. Any suspicions so far?

SARAH: I agree with Paul, I think we should be careful about who we trust. Paul, why did you start this conversation? Are you trying to divert attention away from yourself?

JOHN: Sarah, why do you think Paul started this conversation to divert attention from himself?

EMMA: John, I think Sarah might be trying to divert attention from herself. What do you think?

CHRIS: Sarah, why do you think Paul started this conversation to divert attention from himself?

FLORENT: Sarah, your accusatory tone towards Paul seems suspicious. Why are you trying to divert attention away from yourself?

LÉO: Sarah, your accusatory tone towards Paul seems suspicious. Why are you trying to divert attention away from yourself?

QUENTIN: Sarah, why are you accusing Paul of diverting attention when there is no evidence to support it?

CHARBEL: John, why are you questioning Sarah's accusations? Are you trying to divert attention from yourself?

SAM: Sarah seems to be deflecting attention from herself, and John and Charbel seem to be defending her. I'll keep an eye on them.

GREG: Sarah, why are you deflecting attention from yourself and accusing Paul without any evidence?

PAUL: Sarah, your accusations towards me seem baseless and you haven't provided any evidence. Why are you deflecting attention from yourself?

SARAH: Paul, your insistence on accusing me without evidence seems suspicious. I believe you are trying to divert attention from yourself.

JOHN: Sarah, why do you continue to accuse Paul without providing any evidence? Are you trying to divert attention from yourself?

EMMA: John, why are you defending Sarah and trying to deflect attention from her? Are you working together?

CHRIS: Sarah and John, you both seem to be defending each other. Are you both werewolves trying to protect each other?

FLORENT: Sarah, your insistence on accusing Paul without any evidence only raises more suspicion on you.

LÉO: John, your defense of Sarah and questioning of others makes me think you might be a werewolf too. I suggest we vote for John.

QUENTIN: Sarah, why are you so insistent on accusing Paul without any evidence? Are you trying to divert attention from yourself as a werewolf?

CHARBEL: Sarah, your constant accusations and deflection seem very suspicious. I think we should vote for Sarah.

SAM: John, can you explain why you continue to defend Sarah and deflect suspicion away from her?
