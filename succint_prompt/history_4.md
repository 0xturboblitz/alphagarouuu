Game 4:

PAUL: Hello everyone, it's nice to meet you all. I suggest we start by introducing ourselves and sharing any suspicions or information we may have. This way, we can work together to uncover the werewolves among us.

SARAH: Hello, everyone! I'm Sarah. It's great to meet you all. I'm just a regular villager, wanting what's best for our community. I think we should focus on gathering as much information as possible before making any hasty decisions. What do you all think?

JOHN: Hello, everyone! I'm John. It's nice to meet you all. Like Sarah mentioned, I think it's important for us to gather information and be cautious before making any decisions. Does anyone have any initial suspicions or thoughts on the matter?

EMMA: Hi everyone, I'm Emma. It's great to meet you all. I think we should definitely be cautious and gather information before jumping to any conclusions. John, do you have any specific suspicions or thoughts on who the werewolves might be?

CHRIS: Hello everyone, I'm Chris. Nice to meet you all. I agree with Sarah and John that we should gather more information before making any decisions. At this point, I don't have any suspicions yet. Let's continue the conversation and see if anything comes up.

PAUL: Emma, do you have any suspicions or thoughts on who the werewolves might be?

SARAH: Thanks for sharing your thoughts, Paul. I don't have any specific suspicions yet, but I think we should all keep an eye on John. He seems a little too eager to gather information and be cautious. It might be an act to divert attention from himself. What does everyone else think?

JOHN: I understand your concern, Sarah, but I assure you my eagerness to gather information is simply because I want to make sure we make the right decision. I don't have any suspicions yet, but I believe it's important for us to be proactive in our approach.

EMMA: John, I have a feeling that Paul might be hiding something. He's been quite quiet and evasive during our discussion. What do you think?

CHRIS: Emma, why do you think Paul might be hiding something? Can you provide any specific reasons or observations?
