John, as a detective, you must be skilled at finding the truth. How do you plan on using your detective skills to uncover the werewolves?

CHRIS: Hi everyone, my name is Chris. I work as a pharmacist. John, as a detective, I'm curious to know if you have any techniques or strategies that you typically use to solve crimes. Perhaps you can apply those skills to identify the werewolves among us.

PAUL: Hello Sarah, nice to meet you. I work as a software developer. It sounds fascinating to be a wildlife photographer. Have you ever captured any rare or endangered species in your photographs?

SARAH: Hi Paul, it's great to meet another person working in a technical field. Being a wildlife photographer must be exciting, Sarah. Have you encountered any dangerous animals during your work?

EMMA: Hello everyone, my name is Emma and I work as a nurse. John, I'm curious to know if being a detective has made you overly suspicious of people? Sometimes, suspicion can lead us in the wrong direction and innocent people might get accused. It's important to approach this game with an open mind and consider all possibilities.

CHRIS: John, as a detective, you mentioned earlier that you specialize in solving crimes. Have you ever encountered any cases involving animals or wildlife? It could be interesting to hear about any experiences you've had that might relate to the werewolves we're trying to uncover.
