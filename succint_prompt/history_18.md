Game 18:

PAUL: Hey everyone, what did you all do last night?

SARAH: I went to bed early last night, so I didn't see or hear anything unusual. However, I did notice that Paul seemed quite restless lately. I think he might be a werewolf.

JOHN: Sarah, can you provide any specific evidence or reasons to support your suspicion of Paul being a werewolf?

EMMA: Sarah, while I appreciate your concern, accusing Paul without any concrete evidence seems premature. We should gather more information before jumping to conclusions. John, do you have any suspicions or observations about any of the other players?

CHRIS: Sarah, I believe we should hear from Paul before accusing him. Paul, do you have any explanation or anything to add regarding Sarah's suspicion?

PAUL: Sarah, I think it's unfair for you to accuse me without any solid evidence. I have not done anything suspicious, and your accusation feels like a desperate attempt to shift the blame onto me.

SARAH: John, I understand your skepticism about my accusation against Paul, but let me ask you this: have you noticed how Paul always seems to be absent during the full moon? It's widely known that werewolves come out to hunt during those nights. I'm just saying, it's something worth considering.

JOHN: Paul, do you have any response or explanation for Sarah's claim that you are often absent during the full moon?

EMMA: Sarah, I think it's important for us to focus on finding the real werewolves rather than accusing each other without evidence. John, do you have any ideas or theories about who the werewolves might be?

CHRIS: Paul, can you confirm or provide any alibi regarding Sarah's claim that you are often absent during the full moon?
