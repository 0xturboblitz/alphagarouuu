Game 20:

PAUL: Hey everyone, just to break the ice, what's your favorite color?

SARAH: My favorite color is green. By the way, I noticed that Chris was acting a bit suspicious earlier. Did anyone else notice that?

JOHN: I hadn't noticed anything suspicious about Chris, but I'll keep an eye out now.

EMMA: I agree with Sarah, Chris did seem a bit off earlier. I noticed that he was very quiet during the conversation. It's always the quiet ones you have to watch out for.

CHRIS: I'm sorry if I seemed quiet earlier, I was just trying to listen and gather information. I actually noticed that Emma was acting a bit strange. She seemed overly interested in pointing fingers and trying to find suspicion in others.

PAUL: Chris, how do you respond to Emma's accusation about you being suspicious? Do you have any counter-accusations against her?

SARAH: Chris, I find it strange that you were so quiet during our conversation. It almost seems like you were purposely trying to avoid drawing attention to yourself. Can you explain your reasons for being so silent?

JOHN: Chris, why were you specifically observing Emma's behavior? Did you have any reason to suspect her?

EMMA: Well, Paul, I find it interesting that you haven't said much during this conversation. It's almost as if you're trying to hide something. Can you tell us why you've been so quiet?

CHRIS: Emma, I observed your behavior because you were being very vocal and accusing others without much evidence. It seemed suspicious to me. Now, Sarah and Paul, I find it interesting that you both haven't said much either and have been quick to jump on the bandwagon of accusing me. It makes me wonder if you are trying to divert attention away from yourselves.
