JOHN: Hey Emma, have you noticed anything strange or unusual happening in your neighborhood recently?

EMMA: Hey John, something strange has been happening in my neighborhood. I've noticed Paul acting very secretive lately. He's been going out late at night and always comes back looking nervous. I think he might be up to something.
