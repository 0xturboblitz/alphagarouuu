Game 1:

PAUL: Hello everyone, how is everyone doing today? Has anyone noticed anything out of the ordinary so far?

SARAH: Hey Paul! I'm doing good, thanks for asking. Nothing out of the ordinary that I've noticed. How about you?

JOHN: Hey guys, hope you're all doing well. Have any of you noticed anything strange happening or any behavior that seemed off?

EMMA: Hey Paul, I've noticed something strange about Sarah. She's been acting a bit suspicious to me. Have you noticed anything odd about her?

CHRIS: Hey Emma, can you please share why you find Sarah suspicious? It could help us understand the situation better.

PAUL: Emma, can you please provide specific examples of Sarah's suspicious behavior? It would help us understand your concerns better.

SARAH: Emma, I find it interesting that you are accusing me without providing any solid evidence. It seems like you are trying to divert attention away from yourself. Can you explain why you think I am suspicious?

JOHN: Emma, why do you think Sarah is suspicious? Can you give us any specific examples or observations?

EMMA: Well, Sarah, I noticed that you were unusually quiet during the first round of voting. It seemed like you were trying to fly under the radar and avoid suspicion. That, combined with Emma's observation, raises some concerns. Can you explain why you were so quiet during the first round?

CHRIS: Emma, can you please provide more specific examples of Sarah's suspicious behavior? It would help us evaluate the situation better and make an informed decision.
