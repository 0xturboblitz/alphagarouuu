Game 16:

PAUL: Sarah, tell me, what's your favorite hobby?

SARAH: Oh, I enjoy painting and drawing in my free time. It's a great way for me to relax and express myself.

JOHN: Hey Emma, what about you? What do you enjoy doing in your free time?

EMMA: I enjoy reading and going for long walks in nature. It helps me clear my mind and find inspiration.

CHRIS: Hey Paul, what's your favorite book? And why?

PAUL: Hmm, my favorite book... that's a tough one. I'd have to say it's 'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee. I love how it tackles important themes like justice and racism. What about you, Chris?

SARAH: Chris, what about you? What's your favorite hobby? I would love to know more about you.

JOHN: Hey Sarah, I noticed that you asked Chris about his favorite hobby, but didn't answer Paul's question about your own favorite hobby. Could you please share with us what your favorite hobby is?

EMMA: Sarah, why are you avoiding Paul's question? It seems odd that you would ask Chris about his hobby but not answer Paul's question about your own favorite hobby. Are you hiding something?

CHRIS: Sarah, it's interesting that you asked Chris about his hobby but didn't answer Paul's question. Why are you avoiding it? We all shared our hobbies, so I think it's only fair that you share yours as well.
