Game 5:

PAUL: Let's start off with an easy question. What's your favorite color?

SARAH: My favorite color is blue. It reminds me of the calming and peaceful nature of the ocean.

JOHN: My favorite color is green. It represents growth and renewal.

EMMA: John, what do you think about the color red? Do you associate it with any specific feelings or emotions?

CHRIS: My favorite color is black. It represents mystery and sophistication.

PAUL: My favorite color is purple. It represents creativity and individuality.

SARAH: My favorite color is blue. It reminds me of the calming and peaceful nature of the ocean.

JOHN: Sarah, why did you repeat your answer about your favorite color being blue? Did you not remember that you had already answered that question or did you purposefully try to make yourself seem more innocent?

EMMA: John, it's interesting that you're questioning Sarah for repeating her answer about her favorite color. However, I think it's possible that she might have just forgotten that she had already mentioned it. Sometimes we say things without realizing we've already said them. It doesn't necessarily mean she's trying to deceive anyone.

CHRIS: Emma, what's your favorite color and why?
