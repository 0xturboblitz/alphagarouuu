Game 14:

PAUL: Hello everyone! How is everyone feeling today? Has anyone noticed anything strange happening around here?

SARAH: Hey Paul, I'm feeling good today, thanks for asking. Nothing strange that I've noticed. How about you?

JOHN: Hey everyone, has anyone noticed anything out of the ordinary or suspicious lately?

EMMA: Hey Paul and John, thanks for checking in. I haven't noticed anything strange either, but it's definitely something that we should keep an eye out for. What about you, Chris? Have you noticed anything unusual?

CHRIS: No, I haven't noticed anything unusual, Emma. Just the usual quietness around here.

PAUL: I'm glad to hear that no one has noticed anything unusual. Let's all keep our eyes open and stay vigilant. It's important to keep the lines of communication open and share any concerns we may have.

SARAH: Hey John, I couldn't help but notice that you've been asking a lot of questions about strange things happening. It's a bit odd, don't you think? Are you trying to divert attention away from yourself?

JOHN: Sarah, it's interesting that you find my questions odd. I'm just trying to gather information and make sure we're all on the same page. Why do you think my questions are diverting attention away from me?

EMMA: Sarah, I actually find it suspicious that you're accusing John so quickly. It seems like you're trying to divert attention away from yourself. Can you explain why you're so quick to suspect him?

CHRIS: Sarah, John, it seems like you two have some disagreement going on here. Instead of accusing each other, why don't you both share your reasons for suspecting each other? It might help us all gain a better understanding of the situation.
