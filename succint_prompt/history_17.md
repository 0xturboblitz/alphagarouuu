Game 17:

PAUL: Hello everyone! Let's start by introducing ourselves. What do you do for a living?

SARAH: Hi Paul! I work as a school teacher. It's really fulfilling to educate the future generation.

JOHN: Nice to meet you, Sarah. Being a school teacher must be such a rewarding profession. How about you, Emma? What do you do for a living?

EMMA: I'm actually a freelance artist, John. I specialize in creating abstract paintings and sculptures. It's a unique and fulfilling profession that allows me to express my creativity. How about you, Chris? What do you do for a living?

CHRIS: I work as a software engineer. I love building new applications and solving complex problems. How about you, Paul?

PAUL: Chris, what do you do for a living?

SARAH: Oh, Chris, I'm actually an aspiring writer. I've been working on a mystery novel lately, where the main characters are trying to solve a murder in a small village. It's all about deception, suspicion, and unraveling the truth. It's fascinating how people can appear one way on the surface but hide dark secrets underneath. What about you, Chris? What secrets do you have?

JOHN: Sarah, your mystery novel sounds really interesting. Can you give us a sneak peek into the main character's journey to uncover the truth? What challenges do they face?

EMMA: Well, John, I'm glad you asked about the challenges in the novel. One of the biggest hurdles the main characters face is the constant suspicion and lack of trust within the small village. They never know who they can truly rely on, and everyone seems to have something to hide. It really keeps the readers on edge, trying to piece together the puzzle of who the real murderer is.

CHRIS: It's great to learn about everyone's professions. It seems like we have a diverse group here. As a software engineer, I enjoy solving puzzles and problems, just like Sarah mentioned in her mystery novel. I'm curious, Emma, what inspires your abstract paintings and sculptures? Do you draw inspiration from the human form or is it something else?
