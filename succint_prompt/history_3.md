Game 3:

PAUL: Hello everyone! How is everyone doing today? Any thoughts on who we should vote to eliminate?

SARAH: Hi Paul! I'm doing well, thank you for asking. As for who we should vote to eliminate, I noticed that John has been quite quiet so far. It could be because he is trying to hide something. What do you think?

JOHN: Hi Sarah, I'm sorry if I've been quiet. I've just been trying to observe and take everything in. I don't think being quiet automatically means I'm a werewolf. What are your thoughts on Emma?

EMMA: I agree with Sarah, John has been very quiet and that is definitely suspicious. I think we should focus our attention on him for now and see if he can provide a valid explanation for his silence.

CHRIS: Hi John, I also noticed that you've been quite quiet. Can you explain why? It's important for all of us to participate in this discussion.

PAUL: John, can you explain why you have been so quiet? It's important for all of us to participate in this discussion.

SARAH: John, your explanation for your silence doesn't convince me. We need active participation from everyone to solve this, and your absence is raising red flags. I suggest we vote to eliminate John this round.

JOHN: I apologize for my silence, but as I mentioned earlier, I was just observing and taking everything in. I wanted to gather as much information as possible before actively participating in the discussion. I assure you that I am a villager and have no nefarious intentions.

EMMA: Chris, I've been observing your behavior and it seems a bit suspicious to me. You've been participating in the discussion, but your points seem vague and unclear. Can you explain your reasoning behind your previous statements?

CHRIS: Emma, I apologize if my previous statements seemed vague. I have been trying to carefully analyze the situation and gather information before making any strong accusations. I believe it's important to consider all possibilities and not jump to conclusions too quickly. I assure you that I am a villager and my intentions are genuine.
