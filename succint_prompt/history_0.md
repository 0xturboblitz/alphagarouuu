Game 0:

PAUL: Hello everyone. Since this is the first round and we don't have much information to go on yet, I think it would be helpful if we all shared a little bit about ourselves. It might give us some clues about who could potentially be a werewolf. I'll start. My name is Paul and I'm a simple villager. Anybody else care to share?

SARAH: Hello everyone, my name is Sarah. I'm a villager just like Paul here. It's nice to meet you all. Now, who would like to share next?

JOHN: John: Thank you, Sarah. So, let's talk about our hobbies. What does everyone enjoy doing in their free time?

EMMA: Hello everyone, I'm Emma. In my free time, I enjoy reading mystery novels and taking long walks in nature. How about you, Chris?

CHRIS: I also enjoy reading mystery novels and taking long walks in nature, just like Emma. It's a great way to relax and clear the mind. John, what do you enjoy doing in your free time?

PAUL: John, since we've talked about hobbies, I'm curious to know if you have any pets?

SARAH: I'm curious, Paul. Why did you ask about pets? Are you trying to divert the conversation away from more important matters?

JOHN: Sarah, I asked about pets because I find them to be a common interest among people. It's a good way to get to know someone better. What about you, Sarah? Do you have any pets?

EMMA: I completely agree with Paul and Sarah. Sharing about our hobbies is a great way to get to know each other. For me, I enjoy painting and playing the piano in my free time. It helps me relax and express my creativity. What about you, Chris?

CHRIS: In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and cooking. It's a great way to unwind and try new recipes. Paul, what about you?
